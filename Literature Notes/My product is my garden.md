Entrepreneurs are faced with the challenge of building a business that is fast growing and hiring lots of people, or bootstrapping and going at a more slower pace.

The pressure is to do things fast, and to break things. But is that always the right approach?

Taking the "My Product is My Garden" approach, it gives you permission to think more slowly about the creation of your startup.

You want to do it in small parts, over time and enjoy the process.

To do this, you want to research, explore, practice and master the smaller details that are needed to move it forward. Examples include marketing, sales, copywriting, branding.

By having something that you're passionate about, you can use that as fuel to talk to other people and 'find your tribe'.

Focus on profitability gives you the ability to continue working on it and not having to do another job to have an income.

You are focused on helping your customers with an ever improving product and aren't growing for groth sake.

It is a deliberate action to putter around and enjoy it. You want to keep the pressure light and the enjoyment high.
