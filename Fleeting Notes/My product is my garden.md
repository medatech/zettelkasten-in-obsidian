# My product is my garden
Created: 2021-07-13 15:53

* Some are moonshots, others are sustainable “grow-slowly” types
* I have found my own analogy/ideology. My product is my garden.
* During the early days of lockdown, my girlfriend got deep into gardening. She would spend hours nurturing her tomato plants, weeding, watering, puttering about.
* I want to putter about, feel connected to the process, and have fun doing so.
* I want to make things that don’t scale.
* Being able to talk to, and interact with the people using my tools is fulfilling.
* Obviously, to do this a product has to reach a basic threshold of profitability.
* Not to grow at all cost, but to ensure that people using the tool have an ever-improving experience.
* This is my garden, and I intend to putter.
